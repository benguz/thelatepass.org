# Eat.

If people are skipping school lunch and not eating at all, it doesn’t matter if the food is free. Your school is failing to feed students. That is the most basic need.

Collect data. Bring it to administrators. We’re doing the same nationwide: send us a percentage, we’ll get national news.

DATA:

Count how many kids don't eat during lunch block. Get a percentage.

Answer our survey to get the right play -

Survey:
- People would rather STARVE: the food is too gross
- Buying lunch is STIGMATIZED: people don’t eat it because they’re shunned
- The food is too PRICEY: there are kids begging for morsels next to the lunch line
- There’s not ENOUGH food: people skip breakfast and dinner and lunch is their only meal
- Nobody has TIME to eat: the line is too long or people take an extra class during lunch
