## Happy campers, happy students {% .jumbo %}

The One Fact Foundation is a 501(c)(3) [healthcare](https://onefact.org) and [education](https://thelatepass.org) nonprofit that runs nationwide programs and small, creative experiments. When we build a hospital price search engine, we start by talking to folks from communities most affected by high deductibles. While we build our student support network, we start by empowering small groups of kids and listening to their needs. School's out over the summer, but that doesn't mean we stop working with students!

- #### Camp is 90% summer fun and 10% preparing you to have more fun in school.
- #### Nonprofit-run with support from community leaders
- #### Students will leave braver, more collaborative, and ready to speak up!

# Our Values

At Camp Late Pass, we're all about fun, learning, and adventure. Our campers get the chance to explore 15 acres of beautiful wilderness, home to a variety of wildlife. They'll spend their days hiking, playing games, and even getting up close and personal with our very own live animal ambassadors (dogs)! And when the day is done, campers can relax in our clean, renovated housing, surrounded by their new best friends.

Our exceptional staff sets us apart from other summer camps. We handpick our team, consisting of passionate college students, classroom teachers, and full-time educators who bring their expertise and enthusiasm to Camp Late Pass. All staff members are CPR and first aid trained and follow state and county COVID-19 protocols to ensure a safe and exciting camp experience. We maintain a 1:5 ratio for most camp activities, providing the perfect blend of personalized attention and group fun!

Camp Late Pass is more than just your average summer camp â€“ it's a place where campers will leave braver, more collaborative, and ready to speak up! So, what are you waiting for? Join us at Camp Late Pass and experience a summer you'll never forget! [Reach out](mailto:ben@onefact.org) and learn more.
