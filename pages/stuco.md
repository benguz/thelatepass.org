# Leadership Therapy: A playbook for changing your school.

Most student councils feel like party planning committees. 

Everyone running for election gives a big speech about how excited and committed and organized they are, or about how they're gonna make so many good changes for the student body. But... nobody's really sure what a "student leader" should be doing. Like, they can't get rid of homework.

But there's a lot wrong with school. People aren't staring out the window or cutting class because they're living it up.

More importantly, **there's a lot wrong with school that can be changed**. Disgusting bathrooms, awful lunches, unfair grading, or getting [$10k in funding](https://www.the74million.org/article/students-got-10k-to-upgrade-their-hs-it-drove-a-citywide-wave-of-democracy/) for the most critical unmet student need...

We can help you come to the bargaining table with even the most uncommunicative administrators by teaching you individual and community advocacy skills. We'll come to a student council/government meeting, listen to what's stressing you out, and share research-backed strategies for achieving change. We're a nonprofit run by former window-starers who wish we had the leadership skillset then that we have now: we wouldn't have felt so powerless in school. We don't want another student to have the same regret.

Here's our playbook.

---

- *Authorizing peer perspectives*
- Identify student body needs and anxieties ([active listening](/doorstops/listen), motivational interviewing)
- Collect data (How many people are eating lunch? Food is a basic need. How much [class time](/time) is spent on learning? Our numbers are <50%)

---

- *Acting on unmet needs with SEL strategies*
- Negotiation and self advocacy 101
- [Find promises](/takingsteps) your administration has made to the school board. Nudge them to stay on track

---

- *Achieving long-lasting change*
- Themed protests and brief walkouts (and getting teachers advance notice)
- Getting clubs, sports teams, and parents on board, plus support from a nationwide community of student leaders pushing for the same changes
