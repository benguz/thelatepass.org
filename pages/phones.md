# Reduce phone use by authorizing student perspectives

"Less homework! Shorter school days! Better food!" Inundated with these revolutionary ideas from students, schools closed their suggestion boxes a long time ago. But with phones in their hand and between 2.4 and 5 GHz of bandwidth at their fingertips, students have something we never had as kids: leverage. Instead of wrangling phones out of their hands (pain, angst, a frustrated PTO), ask them, what do you want in exchange?

**When students are involved in the decision-making process, they are more likely to accept the change**—and when they feel heard, they'll start voicing actionable, feasible opportunities for change.[^1](#^1)

"More class time when we don’t have to sit at our desks! A lower student-counselor ratio! A career day? More basketballs in the gym!"

Bringing student ideas to conversations with administrators changes student perspectives, whether that’s an invite to a weekly PD or running a schoolwide assembly. When students **understand why phone use hurts teachers, their learning, and the school itself** and when **students can negotiate for their unmet needs**, school becomes a place of trust, not powerlessness. 

This is not to say students should be involved in every decision: you can’t lead by committee. But giving kids a voice—and not only to the outspoken student leaders, but to every student—is life-changing. Students have actionable ideas in [every school community](https://www.the74million.org/article/students-got-10k-to-upgrade-their-hs-it-drove-a-citywide-wave-of-democracy/): let's help them raise their hand.

We facilitate these conversations at no cost to schools.
