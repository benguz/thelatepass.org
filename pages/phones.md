# Reduce phone use by authorizing student perspectives

Chronic phone use is often seen as a policy problem: all teachers need to unilaterally agree to crack down on usage. However, when students are involved in the decision-making process, they are more likely to accept the change and more likely to reach a mutually beneficial consensus. You’re asking students to give up phones, what do they want in return? It’s hard to get an actionable, feasible response to a question like this: most students either don’t know how to change school at first, or their suggestions sound more like “Shorter days!” or “Better food!” than “More class time when we don’t have to sit at our desks!” or “A lower student-counselor ratio!” By fostering safe, reflective spaces for students to think about their school experiences and what they’d change—then
bringing these ideas to conversations with administrators, whether that’s an invite to part of a weekly PD meeting or a schoolwide assembly. When students **understand why phone use hurts teachers, their learning, and the school itself** and when **students can negotiate for their unmet needs**, school becomes a place of trust, not powerlessness. 

This is not to say students should be involved in every decision: you can’t lead by committee. But giving them a voice—and not only to the outspoken student leaders, but to every student—is life-changing.

Interestingly, a lot of students want schools to offer more diverse courses, which is more on the attainable end of large scale change.
