# Reduce phone use by authorizing student perspectives

Chronic phone use is not a policy problem. It's possible to wrangle every teacher into agreement and crack down unilaterally on usage, but there's a better way. You’re asking students to give up phones, what do they want in exchange? **When students are involved in the decision-making process, they are more likely to accept the change**—and when they feel heard, they'll start voicing anxieties, frustrations, and opportunities for growth.[^1](#^1)

Getting an actionable, feasible response is hard: most students either don’t know how to change school at first, or their suggestions sound more like “Shorter days!” or “Better food!” than “More class time when we don’t have to sit at our desks!” or “A lower student-counselor ratio!” But fostering safe, reflective spaces for students to think about their school experiences and what they’d change is essential:

Across classrooms, school districts, and state lines, schools are missing the same opportunities to improve student self-esteem and success. These opportunities center around trust, one of the few factors shown to impact everything from attendance to teacher retention, even when controlled for socioeconomic status.[^2](#^2) Bringing students to the bargaining table once in a while does volumes to build it.

Trust is psychological safety, vulnerability, and hope: “I trust that you’ll listen intently if I share something personal.” It’s intuitive to most adults: a combination of behavior (e.g. eye contact, firm handshakes, keeping a promise) and intention (mutual respect, shared values). In school, trust is impeded by a complex student-teacher power dynamic, a lack of space to address student anxieties, and a pervasive feeling of lost agency. Intention is chronically absent and behavior suffers as a result.

Bringing student ideas to conversations with administrators, whether that’s an invite to part of a weekly PD meeting or a schoolwide assembly, changes student perspectives. When students **understand why phone use hurts teachers, their learning, and the school itself** and when **students can negotiate for their unmet needs**, school becomes a place of trust, not powerlessness. 

This is not to say students should be involved in every decision: you can’t lead by committee. But giving kids a voice—and not only to the outspoken student leaders, but to every student—is life-changing. Students have actionable ideas in [every school community](https://www.the74million.org/article/students-got-10k-to-upgrade-their-hs-it-drove-a-citywide-wave-of-democracy/) that sit quietly in the back of their heads, afraid to 'raise a hand.'

We facilitate these conversations at no cost to schools.
