Every edtech company, every book on schooling, and every teaching ideology sells itself the same way:

1. School is BROKEN. It isn't meeting individual needs.
2. We need CHANGE. Big change.* 
3. Buy my software/book/course.
*We can't really achieve change with my idea, but it's definitely the best start. Maybe.

Examples: [twitter](https://twitter.com/naomicfisher/status/1627436103748800512?t=XFENE2aM2_SYwu6QKz94hA&s=01), [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7008618196119293952/).

School is broken, it's true, and sometimes what folks are selling is genuinely good. 

But.

**School can't be changed.** It is nearly impossible for _any_ system to meet every student's needs, and reforming the current system to do that _IS_ impossible.

What are we going to do to help "powerless" kids RIGHT NOW? We teach them to navigate the system they're stuck in.

Here's a thought experiment to prove it's possible:

- Was there a teacher you hated in high school? Maybe an administrator who really hurt you? A policy that made your life miserable?
- If you went back through high school again, what would you have done differently to change those bad experiences? 
- Maybe you would've been more assertive, gotten up and walked out, or not been afraid of getting marked down. 
- Can a high schooler be taught to do the same?

Yes. That's what we do.
