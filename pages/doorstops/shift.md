# Schoolwide Culture Shift

School doesn’t have to be toxic. A lot of what makes school awful doesn’t have to be there…

One guy literally overthrew Italy, like, [recently](/coup). And you think there’s no way to change school? 

We've collected strategies from on field-tested research, CIA counterterrorist orgs, Mean Girls, and interviews with students, teachers, and experts on culture change worldwide. 

Here’s all the ways schools can have toxic vibes^TM


{% table %}

---


- Judgey people to an extreme.
- Bullying. Straight up.
- Violence. People hiding in the bathroom, afraid to go to lunch.
- Small jabs, whispering insults at you in the halls… middle school shit
- [Guys do awful shit to girls](#the-man-to-man), nobody says anything.

---

- Nobody shows up… because the school is awful
- Emotional unavailability (*cough* men)
- Boredom. 
- Nobody gives a fuck. About anything.
- Nobody respects teachers. So class gets… loud.

---

- Anxiety.
- Insecurity: people cry about math homework, think they’re dumb
- Competition… to an extreme, “wha-wha-whadidya get on the test”
- Harassment: Male teachers make female students uncomfortable.
- Powerlessness. People feel trapped at their desks.

---

- Racism and bigotry is tolerated and/or endorsed.
- Admin doesn’t communicate: “a girl killed herself, they didn’t say anything”
- Disgust: unusable bathrooms, awful school lunches that nobody eats
- Your guidance counselors do an awful job, nobody does anything about it
- [There is no money in the school district](#the-economist). Teachers are burnt out.

---

- You get put down for trying hard, or even for caring.
- High school is a dead end. It’s McDonalds or getting famous.
- Strictness: Getting up from your desk is not allowed. 
- Why?: You feel like you’re not learning anything important.
- There are extreme social divides, rich/poor, black/white.
