# Leverage School

## School can be really fucked up, or just, like, suck a little

Travelling to schools in 14 states, we saw kids who:
- Didn't eat, with no food at home or social stigma on getting school lunch
- Didn't sleep, with crippling social anxiety or unsafe home lives
- Brought guns, tasers, knives, or thousands of dollars' worth of drugs into school
- Didn't know their teacher's names

Almost worse are the **smaller, solvable, but ignored problems**.

Unacknowledged anxiety, toxic and unnecessary stress, distrust for teachers, fear of asking for help, and **powerlessness**. Is anyone working on this stuff?

 
## Even a small change is nearly impossible... (scroll for cheat code)

Everybody has a VETO: 
- Administrators
- The school board
- The district
- Teachers
- Teacher's unions
- Parents
- The PTO 
- Voters and locals
- The superintendents association
- State policymakers
- Federal policymakers

  
If any ONE GROUP doesn't like a change, it won't happen because every group is strong enough to stop the rest. And what would all these people ever agree on? 

More importantly, **who is missing from the list**?

&nbsp;


Students.
     
 
## Even a tiny change is nearly impossible, but we got a cheat code

Without students, there is no school. 

If you idiots all walked out tomorrow and said you wouldn't come back until the disgusting fucking bathrooms were fixed, they would get fixed. If you went on strike for a week telling the school to hire more social workers, they would.

If you just want to do better in class, be less stressed, or even eat better food for lunch YOU HAVE SMALL, POWERFUL WAYS TO ACHIEVE THAT THAT, TOO.

School is BUILT FOR YOU. **Education is an industry that collapses without students, but acts like students don't exist**.

YES. IT IS MOSTLY DAYCARE. Only half your time is learning time.[^1]

That means you can spend the other half **learning lifelong skills and getting happier**.

We'll be your sherpas. You'll find a collection of Doorstops, ways to TAKE AGENCY in school from asking for an extension on an assignment to turning the whole culture upside-down with research-tested strategies.

Why does all this stuff work? KINDNESS.

No, just kidding, but kindness is close: it all comes back to trust. 

Student-teacher trust is the **highest impact variable** on success, self-esteem, and belonging that **you can control**.[^2] Smaller class sizes, higher paid teachers, and more counselors are shown to help more, but that'll take a lot to change. Doesn't every movie character you love have a mentor? Trust changes lives, even when controlled for socioeconomic status.[^3]

## Education is an industry. Student happiness and mental health is not a priority.

The past 30 years of education reform is viewed as a comprehensive failure.[^4]

State policymakers implement policies that give them the most federal funding: Massachusetts took $250 million cash from the federal government to make a change they knew would make classes worse [^5] Federal policymakers (and the public) focus on irrelevant debates and often think teachers are underworked and overpaid. They couldn't be more wrong.[^6]

Meanwhile, education consultants brought in $2.9 billion in 2022.[^7] Did anyone ever ask you for input? Feedback? Give you time to reflect on school?

Imagine being forced to stay at a job for the rest of your life... before you've even had your first day. You've been plowed through 8 years of school without anybody asking you how you feel about it! Wouldn't there maybe be some useful change if they did?

We did. We've had 80 one-on-one conversations with high school students in 14 states, and we're looking to have more. If you want us to develop a Doorstop for you, we'll make it happen. We've got a network of hostage negotiators, professional chefs, cancer survivors, and frustrated, curious students eager to help. Reach out to ben@onefact.org or text ###.

## Reformers want to create more good classrooms. They don't help kids stuck in bad ones.

Charter schools, progressive education policy, social-emotional learning. When implemented right, stuff like this can help. But what if it doesn't help _you_? Maybe the school you're at doesn't have "mental health" in its vocabulary, or the environment is so toxic that folks have abandonned it. 

We go directly to students. That way, we can try to reach every kid. You're the kid, kiddo.
