## Respecting and Protecting Students

To get a diverse sample of schools, we randomize the selection and outreach process with a list of mostly Title I schools, and find emails through those schools' staff directories.

All our work is anonymized, and focuses on student-teacher relationships in general, not on experiences with any individual or one school.

On top of that, we confirm with every teacher, student, parent, and (if relevant) administrator before publishing anything remotely personal.
